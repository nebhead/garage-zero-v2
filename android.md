## Adding App to your Homescreen using Chrome on your Android Phone

If you are an Android person, you are likely to be using Chrome on your phone and can not only setup a link to the web-app on your homescreen, but it also makes the interface look like a native application.  Pretty cool right?  Well here's how you set this up, it's very simple.  

First, navigate to the instance of the application in your Chrome browser on your phone.  Remember, it's as easy as going to the IP address that was assigned to you device.  Then, from the Chrome drop-down menu in the upper right of the screen, select "Add to Home screen".

Then, when the new dialog box pops up, you will have the opportunity to rename the application, or keep the default.

And there you have it, you've not only created a quick link to your web-app, but you've also created a pseudo application at the same time.
